## 1. Credit Risk - 2022
### Problem Introduction:

When an individual or a company applies for a loan, the lender must assess whether the applicant can reliably repay both the principal and interest. Credit risk is defined as the probability of loan default by the applicant, with 1 representing default. A clear example of an interpretability model for risk is found in mortgage approval models. These models must be able to explain to an applicant why their credit request was approved or denied, so the model must have a readily interpretable nature.
